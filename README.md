## This project has become redundant (yay!)

## The same functionality is available natively in Terragrunt since [version 0.19.20](https://github.com/nholuongut/nholuong-terragrunt/releases/tag/v0.19.20) (released 15th of August 2019).

### See [PR #3](https://github.com/nholuongut/tfvars-annotations/pull/3) for the explanation and some extra unreleased code if you want to continue developing this for Terraform.

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is awesome!
 
As of today, Terraform 0.11 and 0.12 support only static (known, fixed, already computed) values in `tfvars` files. There is no way to use Terraform interpolation functions, or data-sources inside `tfvars` files in Terraform to update values.

While working on [modules.tf](https://github.com/nholuongut/modules.tf-lambda) (a tool which converts visual diagrams created with [Cloudcraft.co](https://cloudcraft.co/) into Terraform configurations), I had a need to generate code which would chain invocations of [Terraform AWS modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules) and pass arguments between them without requiring any extra Terraform code as a glue. [Terragrunt](https://github.com/nholuongut/nholuong-terragrunt) is a great fit for this, it allows to reduce amount of Terraform configurations by reusing Terraform modules and providing arguments as values in `tfvars` files.

Some languages I know have concepts like annotations and decorators, so at first I made a [shell script](https://github.com/nholuongut/modules.tf-lambda/blob/v1.2.0/templates/terragrunt-common-layer/common/scripts/update_dynamic_values_in_tfvars.sh) which replaced values in `tfvars` based on annotations and was called by Terragrunt hooks. `tfvars-annotations` shares the same goal and it has no external dependencies (except `terraform` or `terragrunt`).


## Use cases

1. modules.tf and Terragrunt (recommended)
1. Terraform (not implemented yet)
1. General example - AMI ID, AWS region

## Features

1. Supported annotations:
  - [x] terragrunt_output:
     - `@tfvars:terragrunt_output.vpc.vpc_id`
     - `@tfvars:terragrunt_output.security-group.this_security_group_id`
  - [ ] terraform_output
  - [ ] data-sources generic
1. Type wrapping:
  - `to_list`: Wrap original value with `[]` to make it it as a list

## How to use

Run `tfvars-annotations` before `terraform plan, apply, refresh`.

It will process tfvars file in the current directory and set updated values.

E.g.:

    $ tfvars-annotations examples/project1-terragrunt/eu-west-1/app
    $ terraform plan
 
## How to disable processing entirely

Put `@tfvars:disable_annotations` anywhere in the `terraform.tfvars` to not process the file.

## Examples

See `examples` for some basics.

## To-do

1. Get values from other sources:
 - data sources generic
 - aws_account_id or aws_region data sources
2. terragrunt_outputs from stacks:
 - in any folder
 - in current region
3. cache values unless stack is changed/updated
4. functions (limit(2), to_list)
5. rewrite in go (invoke like this => update_dynamic_values_in_tfvars ${get_parent_tfvars_dir()}/${path_relative_to_include()})
6. make it much faster, less verbose
7. add dry-run flag
8. Proposed syntax:

 - `@tfvars:terragrunt_output.security-group_5.this_security_group_id.to_list`

 - `@tfvars:terragrunt_output.["eu-west-1/security-group_5"].this_security_group_id.to_list`

 - `@tfvars:terragrunt_output.["global/route53-zones"].zone_id`

 - `@tfvars:terragrunt_data.aws_region.zone_id`

 - `@tfvars:terragrunt_data.aws_region[{current=true}].zone_id`

## Bugs

1. Add support for `maps` (and lists of maps). Strange bugs with rendering comments in wrong places.

## Installation

On OSX, install it with Homebrew (not enough github stars to get it to the official repo):

```
brew install -s HomebrewFormula/tfvars-annotations.rb
```

Alternatively, you can download a [release](https://github.com/nholuongut/tfvars-annotations/releases) suitable for your platform and unzip it. Make sure the `tfvars-annotations` binary is executable, and you're ready to go.

You can also install it like this:

```
go get github.com/nholuongut/tfvars-annotations
```

Or run it from source:

```
go run . -debug examples/project1-terragrunt/eu-west-1/app
go run . examples/project1-terragrunt/eu-west-1/app
```

## Release

1. Make GitHub Release: `hub release create v0.0.3`. Then Github Actions will build binaries and attach them to Github release.
2. Update Homebrew version in `HomebrewFormula/tfvars-annotations.rb`. Install locally - `brew install -s HomebrewFormula/tfvars-annotations.rb`
